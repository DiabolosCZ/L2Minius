Primarily, I am investigating the intelligence of the Drako, and whether or not they are cognitive enough to know how much they've changed to fit this new environment. The root of my research lies in the study of their books... so much books. But I've used it all and still my results are unsatisfying. Could you possibly gather more of the Olympus books for me? it's very important!
