Primarily, I am investigating the intelligence of the Drakos, and whether or not they are cognitive enough to know how much they've changed to fit this new environment. The root of my research lies in the study of their claws... so much claws. But I've used it all and still my results are unsatisfying. Could you possibly gather more of the Heaven claw for me? it's very important!
